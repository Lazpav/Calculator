This code is designed to launch a local web-based application using Flask, Dash, and a WebView window. A key challenge addressed here is ensuring that the Flask server (which serves the web app) is fully started before the WebView attempts to load the app. By using PyInstaller, you can easily package this script into a standalone application, making it simple to distribute to friends and colleagues. This approach leverages the powerful UI capabilities of Dash while providing a seamless, user-friendly experience.
